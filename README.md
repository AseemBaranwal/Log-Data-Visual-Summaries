## How to run
Please see that the python file was a google colab file and the dataset was previously mounted on my Google drive and then the data was extracted to create the data frame using Python. To recreate, please mount your drive and then, set the connection onto your own drive and make changes to get the different datasets.

## Tools Used
The project was implemented using Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, stemming, lemmatization, and the front end was created using HTML5, CSS3, and Angular Javascript. The project uses Tableau for the dataset extraction and creation of various plots.

## Demonstration
The project implementation is provided in the code with appropriate annotations. Further, we have created a video which we uploaded on youtube which shows a live demo of how the project works. In addition to this, the website is also hosted on the web. Please check it out for your reference.
