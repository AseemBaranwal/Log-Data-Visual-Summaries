The POK had collected inside memorialize their former chief, Elian Karel, which died last year of the normal causes in prison.  The defenders of POK carried signs with images of Karel and of Juliana Vann, slogans sang, and lit candles.  The peaceful demonstration turned violent one when two members of POK approached a man who tried to enter the building on businesses.  The members of POK struck it with a bottle, which struck it with the ground and gave him a bloody notch on its face.  The police force of Abila tried to gain the ordering of the situation by using foghorns to claim the peaceful dispersion of crowd, but crowd answered their calls while launching insults with some rocks with the leaders.  The police force was accustomed to the teargas to finish the gathering, but a handle of preserving members of POK pushed crowd in the fray with the leaders.  Additional safety forces had to be called with the assistance contain the situation while violence climbed.  When the teargas finally got clear, the member of six POK were stopped on expenses of attack on civil authorities and to incite a crowd with violence.  Three leaders of police force were treated with the hospital general of Abila for wounds received in the combat. We had been concerned that the weak control of Silvia Marek makes it possible to the POK to be succeeded by criminals and hooligans.  The events of today show that our concern was valid, the aforementioned Carman d\' Adrien of spokesman of police force.  Marek replaced Elian Karel as popular figurehead of the movement of POK the last summer. </div></div></div><div class=""ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all close ui-draggable ui-droppable"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""ui-id-67"" id=""dialog66"" style=""outline: 0px; z-index: 1067; position: absolute; height: auto; width: 500px; top: 720.003px; left: 470px; display: block;""><div class=""ui-dialog-titlebar ui-widget-header ui-corner-all ui-helper-clearfix"" style=""white-space: nowrap;""><span id=""ui-id-67"" class=""ui-dialog-title"">Jan 2014, Homeland Illumination </span><div class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-buttonpane"" style=""position: absolute; top: 50%; right: 0.3em; margin-top: -10px; height: 18px;""><a href=""#"" class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-close ui-corner-all"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative; float: right; top: auto; right: auto; margin: 0px; display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-closethick"">close</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-collapse ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-s"">collapse</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-restore ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: block; right: 1.4em;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-newwin"">restore</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-maximize ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink"">maximize</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-minimize ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-minus"">minimize</span></a><a href=""#"" class=""ep title-handle ui-corner-all ui-icon ui-icon-bullet"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative;  margin: 3px;""></a><a href=""#"" class=""scrunchy-button ui-corner-all ui-icon ui-icon-lightbulb"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative;  margin: 3px;""></a></div></div><div id=""jsonDialog66"" class=""doc-set docSet ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content ui-resizable ui-dialog-collapsed"" data-id=""original"" data-source=""set3"" scrolltop=""0"" scrollleft=""0"" style=""width: auto; min-height: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;""><div class=""doc-content"" document_id=""Disappearance70"">Homeland Illumination VOICES - a blog about what is important to the people Maha Salo 20 January 2014 <br><br> 0926 - Welcome to our coverage of today\'s events.  I\'m standing outside the GAStech headquarters waiting for the GAStech executives who are expected to appear within the hour. GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge is celebrating the successful initial public offering of his company, which took place last month.   When they leave here the GAStech executives will travel to the capital building where they will meet with President Kapelou and several of his Ministers and Council members.  A private celebration of their successful alliance is planned to take place later today.  One can\'t help but wonder how much healthcare could be provided with only half the funds used to orchestrate this spectacle. 20 Jan 2014 </div></div></div><div class=""ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all close ui-draggable ui-droppable"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""ui-id-68"" id=""dialog67"" style=""outline: 0px; z-index: 1781; position: absolute; height: auto; width: 500px; top: 760.003px; left: 470px; display: block;""><div class=""ui-dialog-titlebar ui-widget-header ui-corner-all ui-helper-clearfix"" style=""white-space: nowrap;""><span id=""ui-id-68"" class=""ui-dialog-title"">Oct. 1982, Leadership</span><div class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-buttonpane"" style=""position: absolute; top: 50%; right: 0.3em; margin-top: -10px; height: 18px;""><a href=""#"" class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-close ui-corner-all"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative; float: right; top: auto; right: auto; margin: 0px; display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-closethick"">close</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-collapse ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-s"">collapse</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-restore ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: block; right: 1.4em;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-newwin"">restore</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-maximize ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink"">maximize</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-minimize ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-minus"">minimize</span></a><a href=""#"" class=""ep title-handle ui-corner-all ui-icon ui-icon-bullet"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative;  margin: 3px;""></a><a href=""#"" class=""scrunchy-button ui-corner-all ui-icon ui-icon-lightbulb"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative;  margin: 3px;""></a></div></div><div id=""jsonDialog67"" class=""doc-set docSet ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content ui-resizable ui-dialog-collapsed"" data-id=""original"" data-source=""set3"" scrolltop=""0"" scrollleft=""0"" style=""width: auto; min-height: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;""><div class=""doc-content"" document_id=""Disappearance71"">International Times  Leadership 4 October 1982  <br><br> In a Times article from 2 October, it was stated that GASTech president Sten Sanjorge was now less active in the day to day operations of the company.

What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today\'s events.  A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office. </div></div></div><div class=""ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all close ui-draggable ui-droppable"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""ui-id-71"" id=""dialog70"" style=""outline: 0px; z-index: 1071; position: absolute; height: auto; width: 500px; top: 880.003px; left: 470px; display: block;""><div class=""ui-dialog-titlebar ui-widget-header ui-corner-all ui-helper-clearfix"" style=""white-space: nowrap;""><span id=""ui-id-71"" class=""ui-dialog-title"">Jun 2000, DOCUMENTARY CARD OF PUBLIC HEALTH Of ELODIS </span><div class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-buttonpane"" style=""position: absolute; top: 50%; right: 0.3em; margin-top: -10px; height: 18px;""><a href=""#"" class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-close ui-corner-all"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative; float: right; top: auto; right: auto; margin: 0px; display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-closethick"">close</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-collapse ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-s"">collapse</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-restore ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: block; right: 1.4em;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-newwin"">restore</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-maximize ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-extlink"">maximize</span></a><a class=""ui-dialog-titlebar-minimize ui-corner-all ui-state-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" style=""display: none;""><span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-minus"">minimize</span></a><a href=""#"" class=""ep title-handle ui-corner-all ui-icon ui-icon-bullet"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative;  margin: 3px;""></a><a href=""#"" class=""scrunchy-button ui-corner-all ui-icon ui-icon-lightbulb"" role=""button"" style=""position: relative;  margin: 3px;""></a></div></div><div id=""jsonDialog70"" class=""doc-set docSet ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content ui-resizable ui-dialog-collapsed"" data-id=""original"" data-source=""set3"" scrolltop=""0"" scrollleft=""0"" style=""width: auto; min-height: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;""><div class=""doc-content"" document_id=""Disappearance74"">The Orb DOCUMENTARY CARD OF PUBLIC HEALTH Of ELODIS - UPDATE 2000/06/01 ELODIS, Kronos <br><br> the environmental consequences of acid displacement hyper of substrate (HASR), a technique of drilling discussed took an enormous toll on the health of the residents of Elodis.

The report/ratio came in response to the gathering from the protest from one Wednesday by the POK with the registered offices from GAStech - from Kronos. Roughly 200 people met in front of the slogans of song of building of GAStech and the undulating signs pleading people died due the results of the contamination starting from a site of drilling of GAStech. Sanjorge, Jr. answered the complaints of the stating of contamination of GAStech, us [GAStech] worked about it inlassablement to meet - if not exceed - with the international standards of health agreed upon with the government of Kronos before and all drilling. Ten protesters of POK were connected with the door of GAStech - Kronos except the entry with the building. In Sanjorge prolonged of report/ratio Jr. present its argument, if a person is laid out with enfreindre on the private property, if a person is been willing to be connected with a door to prevent businesses from then operating, if a person is been willing to break windows and to burn cars in her own city, this person is been willing to do anything. And if a person is been willing to do anything to achieve their goal of end which they run up against fear in the common citizen. I fear what they will do after because I fear of what they are able.
